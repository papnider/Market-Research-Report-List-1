<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Regenerative Desiccant Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heatless</li><li>Heated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Regenerative desiccant dryers are categorized into two main types: heatless and heated. Heatless dryers use ambient air for regeneration, making them energy-efficient but potentially less effective at very low dew points. They operate by cycling a portion of the dried air to remove moisture from the desiccant materials. Heated dryers, on the other hand, utilize external heat sources to enhance the regeneration process, allowing for greater moisture removal and lower energy consumption in demanding applications. Both types effectively reduce humidity in compressed air systems.</p></p>
